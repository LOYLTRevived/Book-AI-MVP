    "This is nothing but a test: \n\nGot it \u2705 you want this up and running as cheaply as possible and within the next year, even though you\u2019re still pretty new to coding. That\u2019s actually very doable, especially since you don\u2019t need it to be polished for public release \u2014 just functional for you and your brother.\nHere\u2019s a realistic breakdown for you:\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Build Time Estimate (Beginner-Friendly)\nBasic MVP (functional, not pretty):\n\n\n2\u20134 weeks (if you dedicate a few hours daily).",
    "2\u20134 weeks (if you dedicate a few hours daily).\n\n\nYou\u2019d have: upload text \u2192 chunk \u2192 embed \u2192 store in a vector DB \u2192 query overlaps.\n\n\nYou\u2019d be able to start testing debates quickly.\n\n\nUsable Private Tool (stable + citations):\n\n\n2\u20133 months of steady work.\n\n\nThis would include: citations, simple web interface (upload + view results), and saving your verdicts on ideas.\n\n\nRefined Version (for you + your brother):\n\n\n6\u201312 months.",
    "6\u201312 months.\n\n\nAt this stage: multi-user support, shareable debates, maybe custom fine-tuning so the AI \u201cremembers\u201d your reasoning style.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 First-Year Costs (Cheapest Setup)\nHosting/Infra:\n\n\nStart on free tiers:\n\n\nHugging Face (free model inference limited).\n\n\nQdrant Cloud free tier (up to 1GB of vectors).\n\n\nUpgrade later: $20\u201350/month max.\n\n\nTotal first-year spend: <$500 if you keep it lean.",
    "\ud83d\ude80 Strategy for You (Beginner Coder)\nDon\u2019t reinvent the wheel: use existing open-source libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex that already handle document parsing + embeddings + queries.\n\n\nStart with free embedding models (like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) so you don\u2019t pay OpenAI for every embedding.\n\n\nRun locally first \u2192 test on your laptop with SQLite + embeddings. Once it works, push to cloud (cheap VPS or Render).\n\n\nIterate in layers:\n\n\nStep 1: Input text \u2192 extract ideas.",
    "Step 1: Input text \u2192 extract ideas.\n\n\nStep 2: Compare new ideas to old ones.\n\n\nStep 3: Store your decisions (\u201ctrue/false/maybe\u201d).\n\n\nStep 4: Share with your brother.",
    "Step 4: Share with your brother.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Realistically: you could have a basic version running in 1 month, even with your coding background, if you focus only on the core pipeline (text \u2192 embeddings \u2192 vector DB \u2192 query). Everything else (citations, UI, debate logging) can be layered in later.\nDo you want me to map out a step-by-step coding roadmap (week-by-week) so you\u2019d know exactly what to learn/build first to hit that 1-month MVP?",
    "\ud83d\udcc5 Day-by-Day MVP Build Plan (4 Weeks @ 8 hrs/day)\nThis plan assumes ~8 hours/day. With that focus, you\u2019ll move quickly \u2014 finishing the core MVP in 3\u20134 weeks.",
    "Week 1: Setup + Text Ingestion\nDay 1:\nInstall Python + VSCode.\nSet up GitHub repo for version control.\nInstall dependencies: langchain, llama-index, sentence-transformers, qdrant-client, flask.\nWrite hello_world.py to test environment.\nDay 2:\nWrite script to read plain text files (.txt).\nAdd chunking function (split text into ~500-token chunks).\nSave chunks temporarily in JSON.\nDay 3:\nExplore Qdrant Cloud, create free account.\nConnect via qdrant-client.",
    "Connect via qdrant-client.\nStore sample chunks as vectors (use sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).\nDay 4:\nWrite query script: given a chunk, return most similar stored chunks.\nTest by uploading 2\u20133 different small texts.\nDay 5:\nOrganize repo: ingest.py, embed.py, search.py.\nAdd logging so you can see what\u2019s happening at each step.\nDay 6:\nReview + refactor code.\nDocument workflow: \u201cUpload \u2192 Chunk \u2192 Embed \u2192 Store \u2192 Query.\u201d\nDay 7:\nRest / catch-up buffer.",

    "Query top 5 most similar claims.\nDay 12:\nBuild side-by-side comparison output in console:\nNew claim\nRelated past claims + sources\nDay 13:\nRefactor into modules: extract.py, compare.py.\nStart tracking progress in README.\nDay 14:\nRest / catch-up buffer.",
    "Week 3: Manual Review + Storage\nDay 15:\nSet up SQLite DB (sqlite3 in Python).\nCreate schema: claims(id, text, source, vector_id) + judgments(claim_id, verdict).\nDay 16:\nWrite CLI function to log verdicts (true/false/unsure).\nSave verdicts to SQLite.\nDay 17:\nConnect verdicts back into search results.\nWhen related claims show, also show verdicts.\nDay 18:\nAdd ability to update/change verdicts.\nAdd timestamp for when verdict is given.\nDay 19:",
