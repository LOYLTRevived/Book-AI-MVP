    "The Plan\nHow Principles and Claims Work in This System\nAt the heart of this project is the distinction between raw claims and refined principles. This\ndesign ensures that you capture all the information from your sources while also elevating the\nmost important ideas into living principles that guide your thinking.\n1. Raw Claims (Documentation Layer)\n\u25cb When you upload a text, the AI extracts claims from it. These are rewritten into",
    "clear, stand-alone statements but always reference the exact source text they\ncame from.\n\u25cb Claims are automatically grouped by topic or debate line.\n\u25cb All claims remain permanently stored, whether or not you actively use them in\nyour refined system.\n2. Source Text (Context Layer)\n\u25cb Each claim links directly back to the original passages, pages, or paragraphs.\n\u25cb This ensures you can always verify the claim in its original context.",
    "\u25cb When reviewing a claim, you will always see the supporting text alongside it.\n3. Principles (Refined Layer)\n\u25cb The AI also proposes higher-level principles from the uploaded text. These are\nbig ideas or frameworks distilled from multiple claims.\n\u25cb All proposed principles are listed equally; none are ranked automatically.\n\u25cb When multiple authors express similar principles, the AI creates a draft\n\u201ccombined principle\u201d for your review, but the originals remain separate.",
    "\u25cb You refine these principles into your own living belief statements. Edits and\nrewrites are logged so you can track how your thinking evolves over time.\n4. Contradictions and Agreements\n\u25cb Whenever a new claim or principle overlaps with an existing one, the system\nflags it.\n\u25cb Flags appear whether the new content agrees, disagrees, or contradicts existing\nprinciples.\n\u25cb After processing all new principles, you review flagged items and adjust your\nrefined principles accordingly.\n5. Living System",
    "refined principles accordingly.\n5. Living System\n\u25cb The system emphasizes evolution. Each refined principle you submit is saved as\na version, showing how your ideas change over time.\n\u25cb Old versions remain visible as part of your belief history.\n\u25cb Raw claims and source references always remain in the system, whether or not\nyou currently use them.\n6. User Interface\n\u25cb The application will display three equal boxes across the screen:\n\u25a0 Left (Raw Claims) \u2013 automatically extracted claims.",
    "\u25a0 Middle (Source Text) \u2013 the original passages that support each claim.\n\u25a0 Right (Refined Principles) \u2013 higher-level principles you refine into your\nevolving belief system.\n\u25cb Clicking a principle highlights its supporting claims and sources, preserving full\ntraceability.\nNew Plan: Principles-First Workflow\nWeek 1: Core Logic & Database\n\u25cf Add schema for three layers: claims, sources, and principles.\n\u25cf Claims: claim_id, line_id, claim_text, timestamp, source_ref.",
    "\u25cf Principles: principle_id, principle_text, status (active, archived),\ntimestamp, version_history.\n\u25cf Sources: direct references (doc, page, paragraph).\nWeek 2: Principle Extraction & Review Flow\n\u25cf Extend ingestion pipeline:\n\u25cb Extract raw claims from uploaded text.\n\u25cb Generate proposed principles (AI summarization).\n\u25cb Generate optional \u201ccombined principles\u201d where overlaps exist.\n\u25cf Display all proposed principles equally for user review.\n\u25cf Allow user to accept, reject, or edit principles.",
    "\u25cf Save accepted versions with version logging.\nWeek 3: Contradictions and Agreements\n\u25cf Implement contradiction/overlap detection.\n\u25cf When a new principle is added, flag links to pre-existing principles.\n\u25cf Build a \u201cflag review stage\u201d where the user edits or reconciles conflicting principles.\n\u25cf Store relationships: supports, contradicts, overlaps.\nWeek 4: Web Interface with Three-Column Layout\n\u25cf Implement three-column screen layout (claims | sources | principles).",
    "\u25cf Allow toggling between expanded and collapsed views.\n\u25cf Clicking a principle highlights supporting claims and passages.\n\u25cf Add editing tools for refining principles.\n\u25cf Add version history viewer for principles.\nThis principles-first workflow shifts the system away from micro-statements toward capturing,\nrefining, and evolving the big ideas that matter most. Claims and sources serve as the\nevidence base, while your curated principles become the living record of your evolving\nphilosophy."
