This is nothing but a test: 

Got it ✅ you want this up and running as cheaply as possible and within the next year, even though you’re still pretty new to coding. That’s actually very doable, especially since you don’t need it to be polished for public release — just functional for you and your brother.
Here’s a realistic breakdown for you:

🛠️ Build Time Estimate (Beginner-Friendly)
Basic MVP (functional, not pretty):


2–4 weeks (if you dedicate a few hours daily).


You’d have: upload text → chunk → embed → store in a vector DB → query overlaps.


You’d be able to start testing debates quickly.


Usable Private Tool (stable + citations):


2–3 months of steady work.


This would include: citations, simple web interface (upload + view results), and saving your verdicts on ideas.


Refined Version (for you + your brother):


6–12 months.


At this stage: multi-user support, shareable debates, maybe custom fine-tuning so the AI “remembers” your reasoning style.



💰 First-Year Costs (Cheapest Setup)
Hosting/Infra:


Start on free tiers:


Hugging Face (free model inference limited).


Qdrant Cloud free tier (up to 1GB of vectors).


Upgrade later: $20–50/month max.


Total first-year spend: <$500 if you keep it lean.



🚀 Strategy for You (Beginner Coder)
Don’t reinvent the wheel: use existing open-source libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex that already handle document parsing + embeddings + queries.


Start with free embedding models (like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) so you don’t pay OpenAI for every embedding.


Run locally first → test on your laptop with SQLite + embeddings. Once it works, push to cloud (cheap VPS or Render).


Iterate in layers:


Step 1: Input text → extract ideas.


Step 2: Compare new ideas to old ones.


Step 3: Store your decisions (“true/false/maybe”).


Step 4: Share with your brother.



👉 Realistically: you could have a basic version running in 1 month, even with your coding background, if you focus only on the core pipeline (text → embeddings → vector DB → query). Everything else (citations, UI, debate logging) can be layered in later.
Do you want me to map out a step-by-step coding roadmap (week-by-week) so you’d know exactly what to learn/build first to hit that 1-month MVP?

📅 Day-by-Day MVP Build Plan (4 Weeks @ 8 hrs/day)
This plan assumes ~8 hours/day. With that focus, you’ll move quickly — finishing the core MVP in 3–4 weeks.

Week 1: Setup + Text Ingestion
Day 1:
Install Python + VSCode.
Set up GitHub repo for version control.
Install dependencies: langchain, llama-index, sentence-transformers, qdrant-client, flask.
Write hello_world.py to test environment.
Day 2:
Write script to read plain text files (.txt).
Add chunking function (split text into ~500-token chunks).
Save chunks temporarily in JSON.
Day 3:
Explore Qdrant Cloud, create free account.
Connect via qdrant-client.
Store sample chunks as vectors (use sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Day 4:
Write query script: given a chunk, return most similar stored chunks.
Test by uploading 2–3 different small texts.
Day 5:
Organize repo: ingest.py, embed.py, search.py.
Add logging so you can see what’s happening at each step.
Day 6:
Review + refactor code.
Document workflow: “Upload → Chunk → Embed → Store → Query.”
Day 7:
Rest / catch-up buffer.

Week 2: Claims + Comparison
Day 8:
Set up Hugging Face API (free tier).
Test LLM (Llama 3 8B or Mistral) with basic prompts.
Day 9:
Write claim extraction function: prompt LLM → return list of claims.
Save claims with citation metadata (filename, chunk ID).
Day 10:
Test extraction on 1 chapter of a book.
Debug formatting issues (keep claims in clean JSON).
Day 11:
Modify search.py to compare claims (not just chunks).
Query top 5 most similar claims.
Day 12:
Build side-by-side comparison output in console:
New claim
Related past claims + sources
Day 13:
Refactor into modules: extract.py, compare.py.
Start tracking progress in README.
Day 14:
Rest / catch-up buffer.

Week 3: Manual Review + Storage
Day 15:
Set up SQLite DB (sqlite3 in Python).
Create schema: claims(id, text, source, vector_id) + judgments(claim_id, verdict).
Day 16:
Write CLI function to log verdicts (true/false/unsure).
Save verdicts to SQLite.
Day 17:
Connect verdicts back into search results.
When related claims show, also show verdicts.
Day 18:
Add ability to update/change verdicts.
Add timestamp for when verdict is given.
Day 19:
Run full pipeline test: upload → extract claims → compare → review → save verdicts.
Day 20:
Refactor & cleanup.
Write documentation on how to run the system.
Day 21:
Rest / catch-up buffer.

Week 4: Simple Interface + Final MVP
Day 22:
Install Flask.
Create simple upload page (choose file, submit).
Day 23:
Connect Flask route → run pipeline.
Display extracted claims + related claims on webpage.
Day 24:
Add buttons (true/false/unsure) for each claim.
Store verdicts in SQLite.
Day 25:
Build page to view past claims + verdicts.
Add filter: true/false/unsure.
Day 26:
End-to-end test in Flask.
Upload book → claims extracted → comparisons shown → verdicts saved.
Day 27:
Polish UI (basic HTML + Bootstrap).
Add export function (download claims + verdicts as CSV).
Day 28:
Final testing + documentation.
Demo run with 1 full book.

✅ End Result (MVP)
Upload a book/article as text.
Claims automatically extracted + stored with citations.
New claims compared against old claims.
You can mark verdicts (true/false/unsure).
Everything saved in a database.
Simple web interface for use by you + your brother.
