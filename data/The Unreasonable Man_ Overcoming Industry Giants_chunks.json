    "person of fresh initiative or inventive capacity.\nYears ago, psychologists discovered that there are two\nroutes to achievement: conformity and originality. Conformity\nmeans following the crowd down conventional paths and\nmaintaining the status quo. Originality is taking the road less\ntraveled, championing a set of novel ideas that go against the\ngrain but ultimately make things better.\nOf course, nothing is completely original, in the sense that",
    "all of our ideas are influenced by what we learn from the\nworld around us. We are constantly borrowing thoughts,\nwhether intentionally or inadvertently. We\u2019re all vulnerable to\n\u201ckleptomnesia\u201d\u2014accidentally remembering the ideas of others\nas our own. By my definition, originality involves introducing\nand advancing an idea that\u2019s relatively unusual within a\nparticular domain, and that has the potential to improve it.\nOriginality itself starts with creativity: generating a concept",
    "that is both novel and useful. But it doesn\u2019t stop there.\nOriginals are people who take the initiative to make their\nvisions a reality. The Warby Parker founders had the\noriginality to dream up an unconventional way to sell glasses\nonline, but became originals by taking action to make them\neasily accessible and affordable.\nThis book is about how we can all become more original.\nThere\u2019s a surprising clue in the web browser that you use to\nsurf the internet.\nFinding the Faults in Defaults",
    "surf the internet.\nFinding the Faults in Defaults\nNot long ago, economist Michael Housman was leading a\nproject to figure out why some customer service agents stayed\nin their jobs longer than others. Armed with data from over\nthirty thousand employees who handled calls for banks,\nairlines, and cell-phone companies, he suspected that their\nemployment histories would contain telltale signs about their\ncommitment. He thought that people with a history of job-",
    "hopping would quit sooner, but they didn\u2019t: Employees who\nhad held five jobs in the past five years weren\u2019t any more\nlikely to leave their positions than those who had stayed in the\nsame job for five years.\nHunting for other hints, he noticed that his team had\ncaptured information about which internet browser employees\nhad used when they logged in to apply for their jobs. On a\nwhim, he tested whether that choice might be related to\nquitting. He didn\u2019t expect to find any correlation, assuming",
    "that browser preference was purely a matter of taste. But when\nhe looked at the results, he was stunned: Employees who used\nFirefox or Chrome to browse the Web remained in their jobs\n15 percent longer than those who used Internet Explorer or\nSafari.\nThinking it was a coincidence, Housman ran the same\nanalysis for absences from work. The pattern was the same:\nFirefox and Chrome users were 19 percent less likely to miss\nwork than Internet Explorer and Safari fans.",
    "work than Internet Explorer and Safari fans.\nThen he looked at performance. His team had assembled\nnearly three million data points on sales, customer satisfaction,\nand average call length. The Firefox and Chrome users had\nsignificantly higher sales, and their call times were shorter.\nTheir customers were happier, too: After 90 days on the job,\nthe Firefox and Chrome users had customer satisfaction levels\nthat Internet Explorer and Safari users reached only after 120\ndays at work.",
    "days at work.\nIt\u2019s not the browser itself that\u2019s causing them to stick\naround, show up dependably, and succeed. Rather, it\u2019s what\ntheir browser preference signals about their habits. Why are\nthe Firefox and Chrome users more committed and better\nperformers on every metric?\nThe obvious answer was that they\u2019re more tech savvy, so I\nasked Housman if he could explore that. The employees had\nall taken a computer proficiency test, which assessed their",
    "knowledge of keyboard shortcuts, software programs, and\nhardware, as well as a timed test of their typing speed. But the\nFirefox and Chrome group didn\u2019t prove to have significantly\nmore computer expertise, and they weren\u2019t faster or more\naccurate typists. Even after accounting for those scores, the\nbrowser effect persisted. Technical knowledge and skill\nweren\u2019t the source of their advantage.\nWhat made the difference was how they obtained the",
    "browser. If you own a PC, Internet Explorer is built into\nWindows. If you\u2019re a Mac user, your computer came\npreinstalled with Safari. Almost two thirds of the customer\nservice agents used the default browser, never questioning\nwhether a better one was available.\nTo get Firefox or Chrome, you have to demonstrate some\nresourcefulness and download a different browser. Instead of\naccepting the default, you take a bit of initiative to seek out an",
    "option that might be better. And that act of initiative, however\ntiny, is a window into what you do at work.\nThe customer service agents who accepted the defaults of\nInternet Explorer and Safari approached their job the same\nway. They stayed on script in sales calls and followed standard\noperating procedures for handling customer complaints. They\nsaw their job descriptions as fixed, so when they were\nunhappy with their work, they started missing days, and\neventually just quit.",
    "eventually just quit.\nThe employees who took the initiative to change their\nbrowsers to Firefox or Chrome approached their jobs\ndifferently. They looked for novel ways of selling to customers\nand addressing their concerns. When they encountered a\nsituation they didn\u2019t like, they fixed it. Having taken the\ninitiative to improve their circumstances, they had little reason\nto leave. They created the jobs they wanted. But they were the\nexception, not the rule.",
    "exception, not the rule.\nWe live in an Internet Explorer world. Just as almost two\nthirds of the customer service reps used the default browser on\ntheir computers, many of us accept the defaults in our own\nlives. In a series of provocative studies, a team led by political\npsychologist John Jost explored how people responded to\nundesirable default conditions. Compared to European\nAmericans, African Americans were less satisfied with their",
    "economic circumstances but perceived economic inequality as\nmore legitimate and just. Compared to people in the highest\nincome bracket, people in the lowest income bracket were 17\npercent more likely to view economic inequality as necessary.\nAnd when asked whether they would support laws that limit\nthe rights of citizens and the press to criticize the government\nif enacting such legislation was necessary to solve our nation\u2019s\nproblems, twice as many people in the lowest income bracket",
    "were willing to give up the right to free speech as those in the\nhighest income bracket. After finding that disadvantaged\ngroups consistently support the status quo more than\nadvantaged groups, Jost and his colleagues concluded: \u201cPeople\nwho suffer the most from a given state of affairs are\nparadoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or\nchange it.\u201d\nTo explain this peculiar phenomenon, Jost\u2019s team\ndeveloped a theory of system justification. Its core idea is that",
    "people are motivated to rationalize the status quo as legitimate\n\u2014even if it goes directly against their interests. In one study,\nthey tracked Democratic and Republican voters before the\n2000 U.S. presidential election. When George W. Bush gained\nin the polls, Republicans rated him as more desirable, but so\ndid Democrats, who were already preparing justifications for\nthe anticipated status quo. The same happened when Al Gore\u2019s\nlikelihood of success increased: Both Republicans and",
    "Democrats judged him more favorably. Regardless of political\nideologies, when a candidate seemed destined to win, people\nliked him more. When his odds dropped, they liked him less.\nJustifying the default system serves a soothing function.\nIt\u2019s an emotional painkiller: If the world is supposed to be this\nway, we don\u2019t need to be dissatisfied with it. But acquiescence\nalso robs us of the moral outrage to stand against injustice and\nthe creative will to consider alternative ways that the world",
    "could work.\n\u2014\nThe hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and\nexploring whether a better option exists. I\u2019ve spent more than\na decade studying this, and it turns out to be far less difficult\nthan I expected.\nThe starting point is curiosity: pondering why the default\nexists in the first place. We\u2019re driven to question defaults when\nwe experience vuja de, the opposite of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu occurs\nwhen we encounter something new, but it feels as if we\u2019ve",
    "seen it before. Vuja de is the reverse\u2014we face something\nfamiliar, but we see it with a fresh perspective that enables us\nto gain new insights into old problems.\nWithout a vuja de event, Warby Parker wouldn\u2019t have\nexisted. When the founders were sitting in the computer lab on\nthe night they conjured up the company, they had spent a\ncombined sixty years wearing glasses. The product had always\nbeen unreasonably expensive. But until that moment, they had",
    "taken the status quo for granted, never questioning the default\nprice. \u201cThe thought had never crossed my mind,\u201d cofounder\nDave Gilboa says. \u201cI had always considered them a medical\npurchase. I naturally assumed that if a doctor was selling it to\nme, there was some justification for the price.\u201d\nHaving recently waited in line at the Apple Store to buy an\niPhone, he found himself comparing the two products. Glasses\nhad been a staple of human life for nearly a thousand years,",
    "and they\u2019d hardly changed since his grandfather wore them.\nFor the first time, Dave wondered why glasses had such a\nhefty price tag. Why did such a fundamentally simple product\ncost more than a complex smartphone?\nAnyone could have asked those questions and arrived at the\nsame answer that the Warby Parker squad did. Once they\nbecame curious about why the price was so steep, they began\ndoing some research on the eyewear industry. That\u2019s when",
    "they learned that it was dominated by Luxottica, a European\ncompany that had raked in over $7 billion the previous year.\n\u201cUnderstanding that the same company owned LensCrafters\nand Pearle Vision, Ray-Ban and Oakley, and the licenses for\nChanel and Prada prescription frames and sunglasses\u2014all of a\nsudden, it made sense to me why glasses were so expensive,\u201d\nDave says. \u201cNothing in the cost of goods justified the price.\u201d\nTaking advantage of its monopoly status, Luxottica was",
    "charging twenty times the cost. The default wasn\u2019t inherently\nlegitimate; it was a choice made by a group of people at a\ngiven company. And this meant that another group of people\ncould make an alternative choice. \u201cWe could do things\ndifferently,\u201d Dave suddenly understood. \u201cIt was a realization\nthat we could control our own destiny, that we could control\nour own prices.\u201d\nWhen we become curious about the dissatisfying defaults\nin our world, we begin to recognize that most of them have",
    "social origins: Rules and systems were created by people. And\nthat awareness gives us the courage to contemplate how we\ncan change them. Before women gained the right to vote in\nAmerica, many \u201chad never before considered their degraded\nstatus as anything but natural,\u201d historian Jean Baker observes.\nAs the suffrage movement gained momentum, \u201ca growing\nnumber of women were beginning to see that custom, religious\nprecept, and law were in fact man-made and therefore\nreversible.\u201d",
    "reversible.\u201d\nThe Two Faces of Ambition\nThe pressures to accept defaults start much earlier than we\nrealize. If you consider the individuals who will grow up and\nmake a dent in the universe, the first group that probably\ncomes to mind is child prodigies. These geniuses learn to read\nat age two, play Bach at four, breeze through calculus at six,\nand speak seven languages fluently by eight. Their classmates\nshudder with jealousy; their parents rejoice at having won the",
    "lottery. But to paraphrase T. S. Eliot, their careers tend to end\nnot with a bang, but a whimper.\nChild prodigies, it turns out, rarely go on to change the\nworld. When psychologists study history\u2019s most eminent and\ninfluential people, they discover that many of them weren\u2019t\nunusually gifted as children. And if you assemble a large\ngroup of child prodigies and follow them for their entire lives,\nyou\u2019ll find that they don\u2019t outshine their less precocious peers\nfrom families of similar means.",
    "from families of similar means.\nIntuitively, this makes sense. We assume that what gifted\nkids have in book smarts, they lack in street smarts. While\nthey have the intellectual chops, they must lack the social,\nemotional, and practical skills to function in society. When\nyou look at the evidence, though, this explanation falls short:\nLess than a quarter of gifted children suffer from social and\nemotional problems. The vast majority are well-adjusted\u2014as",
    "delightful at a cocktail party as in a spelling bee.\nAlthough child prodigies are often rich in both talent and\nambition, what holds them back from moving the world\nforward is that they don\u2019t learn to be original. As they perform\nin Carnegie Hall, win the science Olympics, and become chess\nchampions, something tragic happens: Practice makes perfect,\nbut it doesn\u2019t make new. The gifted learn to play magnificent\nMozart melodies and beautiful Beethoven symphonies, but",
    "never compose their own original scores. They focus their\nenergy on consuming existing scientific knowledge, not\nproducing new insights. They conform to the codified rules of\nestablished games, rather than inventing their own rules or\ntheir own games. All along the way, they strive to earn the\napproval of their parents and the admiration of their teachers.\nResearch demonstrates that it is the most creative children\nwho are the least likely to become the teacher\u2019s pet. In one",
    "study, elementary school teachers listed their favorite and least\nfavorite students, and then rated both groups on a list of\ncharacteristics. The least favorite students were the non-\nconformists who made up their own rules. Teachers tend to\ndiscriminate against highly creative students, labeling them as\ntroublemakers. In response, many children quickly learn to get\nwith the program, keeping their original ideas to themselves.\nIn the language of author William Deresiewicz, they become",
    "the world\u2019s most excellent sheep.\nIn adulthood, many child prodigies become experts in their\nfields and leaders in their organizations. Yet \u201conly a fraction of\ngifted children eventually become revolutionary adult\ncreators,\u201d laments psychologist Ellen Winner. \u201cThose who do\nmust make a painful transition\u201d from a child who \u201clearns\nrapidly and effortlessly in an established domain\u201d to an adult\nwho \u201cultimately remakes a domain.\u201d\nMost prodigies never make that leap. They apply their",
    "extraordinary abilities in ordinary ways, mastering their jobs\nwithout questioning defaults and without making waves. In\nevery domain they enter, they play it safe by following the\nconventional paths to success. They become doctors who heal\ntheir patients without fighting to fix the broken systems that\nprevent many patients from affording health care in the first\nplace. They become lawyers who defend clients for violating\noutdated laws without trying to transform the laws themselves.",
    "They become teachers who plan engaging algebra lessons\nwithout questioning whether algebra is what their students\nneed to learn. Although we rely on them to keep the world\nrunning smoothly, they keep us running on a treadmill.\nChild prodigies are hindered by achievement motivation.\nThe drive to succeed is responsible for many of the world\u2019s\ngreatest accomplishments. When we\u2019re determined to excel,\nwe have the fuel to work harder, longer, and smarter. But as",
    "cultures rack up a significant number of achievements,\noriginality is increasingly left to a specialized few.\nWhen achievement motivation goes sky-high, it can crowd\nout originality: The more you value achievement, the more\nyou come to dread failure. Instead of aiming for unique\naccomplishments, the intense desire to succeed leads us to\nstrive for guaranteed success. As psychologists Todd Lubart\nand Robert Sternberg put it, \u201cOnce people pass an intermediate",
    "level in the need to achieve, there is evidence that they\nactually become less creative.\u201d\nThe drive to succeed and the accompanying fear of failure\nhave held back some of the greatest creators and change\nagents in history. Concerned with maintaining stability and\nattaining conventional achievements, they have been reluctant\nto pursue originality. Instead of charging full steam ahead with\nassurance, they have been coaxed, convinced, or coerced to",
    "take a stand. While they may seem to have possessed the\nqualities of natural leaders, they were figuratively\u2014and\nsometimes literally\u2014lifted up by followers and peers. If a\nhandful of people hadn\u2019t been cajoled into taking original\naction, America might not exist, the civil rights movement\ncould still be a dream, the Sistine Chapel might be bare, we\nmight still believe the sun revolves around the earth, and the\npersonal computer might never have been popularized.",
