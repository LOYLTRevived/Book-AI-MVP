# search.py

"""
Documentation:

Dependencies:
Requires os, argparse, dotenv, qdrant-client, and sentence-transformers.

Key Functionality:
This script is the main retrieval mechanism for the knowledge base, allowing users to find source material relevant to a question or claim.

    1. Function Name Change
    The primary search function was renamed from the original perfrom_search to the clearer and more consistent semantic_search(query, collection_name, top_k).

    2. Return Value Modification (Critical Change)
    The semantic_search function's return logic was changed to extract and only return the payload (a list of dictionaries) from the Qdrant search results. It no longer returns the complete Qdrant result object which included the score and full metadata.

    3. Execution (main()) â€” Logic Bug Introduced
    The main() function is now logically inconsistent and contains a bug. Because semantic_search no longer returns the full result objects, the code in main() that attempts to access result.score and access payload data via result.payload.get(...) will fail.
    If this script is run standalone, it will likely crash because the dictionary returned by semantic_search (the payload) does not have a .score attribute.

    4. Intended Use
    When used by the RAG orchestrator (helper.py), the script's output (a list of claim payloads containing claim_id) is precisely what is needed for the database filtering step. However, the standalone main() function should be corrected to handle the new return structure or revert the function's internal return logic.
